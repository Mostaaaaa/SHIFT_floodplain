# SHIFT_floodplain
Core codes for SHIFT.

## Description

**SHIFT** (Spatial Heterogeneity Improved Floodplain by Terrain analysis) is a 90-m resolution global geomorphic floodplain map based on terrain analysis. It takes MERIT-Hydro as the terrain input and Floodplain Hydraulic Geometry (FHG) as the thresholding scheme, with the scaling parameters estimated by a stepwise framework that both respects the power law and approximates the spatial extent of hydrodynamic modeling. SHIFT effectively captures the global patterns of the geomorphic floodplains, with better regional details than existing data.
